    "## Architecture and Data Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "- The code loads data from `output1.csv`, which represents game states of a 3x3 grid game (like Tic-Tac-Toe).\n",
    "- Each row in the CSV represents a game, with columns `MOVE1` to `MOVE7` indicating player moves.\n",
    "- The `CLAS` column denotes the game outcome (win, loss, draw).\n",
    "- The goal is to train a model to predict the game outcome based on the board state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Node Features\n",
    "- For each game, the board state is converted into a 9x1 tensor, where each element represents a cell on the board.\n",
    "- The value is `1` for player 1's move, `-1` for player 2's move, and `0` for an empty cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edge Index (Adjacency Matrix)\n",
    "- The `edge_index` tensor defines the connections between cells on the board.\n",
    "- It's a 2x16 tensor, where each column represents an edge connecting two nodes (cells).\n",
    "- The values in each column are the indices of the connected nodes.\n",
    "- In this case, it defines an 8-connected neighborhood, meaning each cell is connected to its immediate neighbors (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Labels\n",
    "- The `CLAS` column is converted to numerical labels using the `class_mapping` dictionary.\n",
    "- 'wi' (win) is mapped to `1`, 'los' (loss) to `0`, and 'dra' (draw) to `2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PyTorch Geometric Data\n",
    "- The node features, edge index, and labels are combined into PyTorch Geometric `Data` objects.\n",
    "- These objects represent graph structures, where nodes are cells on the board, edges represent connections, and labels indicate the game outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Loader\n",
    "- The `DataLoader` is used to batch the data for efficient training.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Architecture (Implied)\n",
    "- Imports `GCNConv` from `torch_geometric.nn`, i.e., using Graph Convolutional Network (GCN).\n",
    "- GCNs are neural networks designed to operate on graph-structured data.\n",
    "- They learn to represent nodes by aggregating information from their neighbors, effectively capturing the relationships between cells on the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "- In this case, we don't focus on overfitting due to the limited number of possible board states, which are nearly 200,000 unique states.\n",
    "- The model was trained for 1250 epochs, achieving an accuracy of approximately 72%, which can be used to play the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "The code prepares graph-structured data representing game states and sets up the foundation for training a GCN model to predict game outcomes based on board configurations.\n"
